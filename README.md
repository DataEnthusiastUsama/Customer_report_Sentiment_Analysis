# Customer_report_Sentiment_Analysis



## IT Readiness Boot Camp Data Science Final Exam Submission

### Overview:

This repository contains my work for the IT Readiness Boot Camp Data Science with Python Final Exam. The exam focused on a real-world scenario involving consumer dispute data from Company XYZ, a financial services provider. The tasks included data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the application of machine learning techniques to address business problems related to consumer disputes.

### Content:

The repository is organized as follows:

1. **Data Wrangling (Lab 01):**
   - Demonstrates the application of data wrangling techniques to clean and refine the consumer dispute data, ensuring data quality and accuracy.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (Lab 02):**
   - Provides an in-depth EDA of the consumer dispute dataset.
   - Identifies five potential business problems related to consumer disputes, laying the foundation for subsequent machine learning solutions.

3. **Machine Learning Models (Lab 03):**
   - Presents three different machine learning models/algorithms to address the identified business problems.
   - Justifies the choice of each model based on its suitability for the specific problem.

4. **Model Evaluation (Lab 03):**
   - Evaluates the performance of each machine learning model using relevant evaluation metrics.
   - Chooses the best-performing model for each problem, providing rationale for the selection.

5. **Sentiment Analysis (Lab 03):**
   - Discusses the identification of a key feature to gauge consumer sentiment.
   - Describes the sentiment analysis approach used to predict whether a consumer dispute will lead to a 'Consumer disputed' outcome.

### How to Use:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Navigate to the respective lab directories to access the code, notebooks, and documentation for each lab.
3. Review the notebooks to understand the data preprocessing, analysis, and machine learning techniques applied.
4. Refer to the model evaluation section to understand the choice of the best models and their performance metrics.
5. Explore the sentiment analysis section to see how consumer sentiment was analyzed and predicted.
